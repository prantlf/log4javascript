log4javascript change log
-------------------------

- Fixed a minor bug with scrolling to the latest message and added "scroll to
  latest" checkbox to console window in InlinePopUpAppender and PopUpAppender.

1.1 (16/5/2006)
- Added configuration option setters on Appenders and refactored to prevent
  config properties being altered directly. Several configuration options
  may not be altered after the appender has been initialized.
- Added scrollToLatestMessage constructor parameter, isScrollToLatestMessage
  and setScrollToLatestMessage methods to InlineAppender and PopUpAppender
- Added isVisible method to InlineAppender
- Changed setShowOneError to setAlertAllErrors in logLog, with obvious change
  in logic
- Added layout property key configuration options to layout constructors for 
  JsonLayout and HttpPostDataLayout
- Changed the default timestamp property name to "timestamp" instead of
  "timeStamp" in JsonLayout and HttpPostDataLayout
- Expanded documentation to include a section in the manual about configuring
  appenders
- Removed browser sniffing code

1.0.1 (30/4/2006)
- Option to have new log messages appear at the top added to InlineAppender and
  PopUpAppender. This option can be specified in the constructor and can also
  be toggled via a checkbox in the console window.
- PopUpAppender changed to not focus the pop-up console window by default, and
  the demo page altered to create its own logger with focussing turned on,
  meaning the behaviour in the demo is essentially unchanged.
